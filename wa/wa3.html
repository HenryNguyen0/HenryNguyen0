        <h2>Son Heung-min</h2>

        <p>
            Son Heung-min (Korean: 손흥민; Korean pronunciation: [son.ɣɯŋ.min]; born 8 July 1992) is a South Korean
            professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur
            and the South Korea national team.[3] Considered one of the best wingers in the world and one of the
            greatest Asian footballers of all time, he is known for his speed, finishing, two-footedness, and ability to
            link play.
            <br>
            <br>
            Born in Chuncheon, South Korea, Son relocated to Germany to join Hamburger SV at 16, making his debut in the
            Bundesliga in 2010. In 2013, he moved to Bayer Leverkusen for a club record €10 million before signing for
            Tottenham for £22 million two years later, becoming the most expensive Asian player in history.[8] While at
            Tottenham, Son became the top Asian goalscorer in both Premier League and Champions League history,[9] and
            surpassed Cha Bum-kun's record for most goals scored by a Korean player in European competition.[10][11][12]
            In 2019, he became the second Asian in history to reach and start a UEFA Champions League final after
            compatriot Park Ji-sung.[13] In the 2021-22 season, alongside Mohamed Salah, he won the Premier League
            Golden Boot award with 23 goals, becoming the first Asian player to win it.[14] In April 2023, he became the
            first Asian player to score 100 Premier League goals. He is also the club's fifth-highest goalscorer and
            all-time leader in assists. Son is the third Tottenham player to make 300 Premier League appearances for the
            club, after Hugo Lloris and Harry Kane.
            <br>
            <br>
            A full international since 2010, Son has represented South Korea at the 2014, 2018, and 2022 FIFA World Cups
            and is his country's joint top scorer at World Cups, tied with Park Ji-sung and Ahn Jung-hwan on three
            goals. Son has also represented South Korea at the 2018 Asian Games, where the team won gold, and the 2011,
            2015, 2019, and 2023 editions of the AFC Asian Cup; Korea was the runner-up in 2015.
            <br>
            <br>
            Outside of football, Son is viewed as a symbol of national pride in South Korea for his achievements, and
            has been listed in Forbes Korea Power Celebrity 40 since 2019, where he ranked second in 2023.[16][17][18]
            In June 2022, Son received the Cheongnyong Medal, the highest order of merit for achievement in sports given
            to a South Korea citizen, for his achievements in football.[19] Son has been credited for having raised the
            profile of Tottenham Hotspur among South Koreans, with the club's marketing and social media strategy
            catering extensively to Korean supporters.

        <h3>Early life</h3>

        <p>
            Son Heung-min was born in Chuncheon, Gangwon.[21] He is of the Miryang Son clan [ko].[22] His father, Son
            Woong-jung, is a retired footballer turned manager who once played for the South Korea national B team.
            <br>
            <br>
            Son came through the academy at FC Seoul, the same club that former Spurs defender Lee Young-pyo played
            for.[24]
            Son was a ball boy in an FC Seoul home match in 2008 when he was a FC Seoul youth player.[25] At that time,
            his
            role model was midfielder Lee Chung-yong, who played for Crystal Palace and Bolton Wanderers.[26][27] Apart
            from
            his native language Korean, Son is also fluent in German and English. His agent Thies Bliemeister said Son
            was
            so determined to make himself a success in Europe that he learned German by watching episodes of SpongeBob
            SquarePants.

        <h3>Club career</h3>
        <h4>Hamburger SV</h4>
        <p>
            In August 2008, Son dropped out of Dongbuk High School's football club (formerly FC Seoul under-18 team)[29]
            and
            joined Hamburger SV's youth academy at age 16 through Korean FA Youth Project [ko].[30][31] A year later, he
            returned to South Korea. After participating in the FIFA U-17 World Cup, he formally joined Hamburger SV's
            youth
            academy in November 2009
            <br>
            <br>
            He was impressive in the 2010–11 pre-season, leading the team with nine goals, and signed his first
            professional
            contract on his 18th birthday.[33] After scoring against Chelsea in August, he was out for two months due to
            a
            foot injury. He returned on 30 October 2010 to score his first league goal, against 1. FC Köln in the 24th
            minute. The goal made Son the youngest Hamburg player to score a goal in the Bundesliga at 18, breaking the
            record held by Manfred Kaltz.
            <br>
            <br>
            Son signed a new deal with Hamburg through 2014. Pundits said he had what it took to become the next Cha
            Bum-kun, a legendary Bundesliga forward and fellow South Korean.[36] Son scored three goals in 14 matches in
            all
            competition during the 2010–11 season.
            <br>
            <br>
            During the 2011–12 pre-season, Son was explosive, scoring 18 times in only nine matches.[38][39][40] After
            missing the opening match due to a fever, Son scored two goals within three matches.[41] On 27 August, Son
            picked up an ankle injury in the 4–3 loss to 1. FC Köln and was initially projected to be out of action for
            four
            to six weeks.[42] His recovery was quicker than expected and he returned to action only three weeks later as
            a
            substitute in a 1–0 loss against Borussia Mönchengladbach on 17 September. Over the course of the 2011–12
            season, he made 30 appearances for Hamburg and scored five goals,[43] including crucial goals against
            Hannover
            96 and 1. FC Nürnberg at the end of the season to help ensure that Hamburg remained in the Bundesliga.
            <br>
            <br>
            Following Hamburger SV's 2012–13 offseason moves, which saw the transfers of the team's strikers Mladen
            Petrić
            and Paolo Guerrero to Fulham and Corinthians respectively, manager Thorsten Fink chose to name Son a
            starter.
            The 2012–13 season was a breakthrough season for Son as he scored two goals in an away fixture against
            Borussia
            Dortmund on 9 February 2013, helping his team to a 4–1 victory. Son was chosen Mann des Tages (Man of the
            Match)
            by kicker.[45] On 14 April, Son netted two goals in a 2–1 win against Mainz 05. He finished the season with
            12
            goals, becoming the fifth South Korean footballer to achieve double digits in goals in Europe.[46] He
            finished
            the 2012–13 season with 12 goals in 34 matches in all competitions.
            <br>
        </p>


        <h4>Bayer Leverkusen</h4>
        <p>
            On 13 June 2013, Bayer Leverkusen confirmed Son's transfer for reportedly €10 million, which was the highest
            transfer fee in the club's history at the time. He agreed to a five-year deal with the team.[48] Son
            adjusted
            quickly to his new club in the pre-season, scoring three goals in his first three appearances for the team
            in
            exhibition matches (against 1860 Munich, Udinese and KAS Eupen respectively).
            <br>
            <br>
            On 9 November 2013, Son scored a hat-trick for Leverkusen in a 5–3 win against his former club Hamburgers
            SV.[50] On 7 December, Son scored a crucial goal against Borussia Dortmund to put his club just four points
            off
            the summit of the Bundesliga. On 10 May 2014, Son scored another goal against Werder Bremen ensuring his
            team a
            spot for the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League.[51] He finished the 2013–14 season with 12 goals in 43 matches.
            <br>
            <br>
            Son scored a hat-trick against VfL Wolfsburg on 14 February 2015, in a 4–5 defeat, scoring when they were
            losing
            0–3.[53] He finished the 2014–15 season with 17 goals in 42 matches.
            <br>
            <br>
            Son started the 2015–16 season with Bayer Leverkusen. He made a league appearance[55] and a Champions League
            qualifying match.
            <br>
        </p>

        <h4>Tottenham Hotspur</h4>
        <h5>2015–16: Debut season</h5>
        <p>
            On 28 August 2015, Son joined Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur for £22 million (€30 million) on a
            five-year
            contract, subject to work permit and international clearance.[57][58] Upon his signing, he became the most
            expensive Asian player in football history.[8] The record had been held since 2001 by Japanese Hidetoshi
            Nakata,
            who transferred from Roma to Parma for €25 million.
            <br>
            <br>
            Son made his debut on 13 September away to Sunderland, being replaced by Andros Townsend in the 62nd minute
            of a 1–0 win.[60] In Tottenham's first match of the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League on 17 September, Son netted
            his first two goals for the club in a 3–1 win against Qarabağ FK.[61] Three days later, he scored his first
            Premier League goal, against Crystal Palace at White Hart Lane, netting in the 68th minute to give Tottenham
            their first home Premier League win of the season.[62] On 28 December in the match against Watford, Son
            replaced Tom Carroll in the 80th minute and scored Tottenham's winning goal in the 89th minute.[63] On 2
            May, he scored the second goal against Chelsea in a crucial match to give Spurs hope of winning the Premier
            League. Chelsea equalised in the second half, however, handing over the title to Leicester City.[

        </p>

        <h5>2016–2018: Breakthrough and Premier League runner-up</h5>
        <p>
            Before the season, he reportedly asked Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino for permission to leave Tottenham
            in an attempt to get more playing time, but was instead given a chance to fight for his place at Spurs.[65]
            On 10 September 2016, Son scored two goals and created a third in his first appearance of the season, in a
            4–0 win against Stoke City.[66] Son followed that performance up with a second brace, coming at
            Middlesbrough on 24 September, earning his team a 1–2 victory.[67] Upon equalling his league goal total from
            the previous season in 25 fewer matches, Son was hailed by Pochettino as "a different person – he's more
            mature and he knows the league and he's settled in fantastically now."[68] Son continued his excellent run
            of form with his fifth goal in five matches on 27 September in the Champions League. Playing at CSKA Moscow,
            Son slipped a shot past goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev for the only goal of the match.[69] On 14 October, Son was
            named the Premier League Player of the Month for September, being the first South Korean and first Asian to
            receive the award.
            <br>
            <br>
            Following the Christmas break Son continued to score the odd goal over the following couple of months and
            then on 12 March 2017 he scored his first Spurs hat trick in the FA Cup against Millwall in a 6–0 win.[71]
            In the same match, he was racially abused by a section of the Millwall fans who chanted "DVD" and "he's
            selling three for a fiver" whenever he touched the ball, referencing a stereotype towards east Asians.[72]
            He scored in the 2–0 victory away at Burnley on 1 April 2017,[73] and four days later he scored in the 91st
            minute to put Spurs ahead at Swansea, in a game where they were losing 1–0 after 88 minutes and ended up
            winning 3–1.[74] A brace at home to Watford the following weekend brought his season total to 18 goals, 11
            in the Premier League, his best ever goals return.[75] On 12 May 2017, Tottenham announced that Son had won
            the Premier League Player of the Month for April, the second time of his career and thus becoming the only
            player in 2016–17 to win the award 2 times.[76] On 18 May 2017, Son bagged a brace away to Leicester City as
            part of a 6–1 rout of their former title rivals. With 21 goals in all competitions, Son joined Harry Kane
            and Dele Alli as the first trio of Spurs players with over 20 goals on the season.
            <br>
            <br>
            Son scored his first goal of the 2017–18 season in the UEFA Champions League game against Borussia Dortmund
            on 13 September 2017 at Spurs temporary home Wembley Stadium, which Spurs won 3–1.[78][79] He scored his
            first Premier League goal in the season when Spurs beat Liverpool 4–1 at home.[80] On 5 November 2017, Son
            scored the only goal in the 1–0 win against Crystal Palace. The goal brought his tally in the Premier League
            to 20 and in doing so he became the top Asian goalscorer in Premier League history, breaking the record set
            by Park Ji-Sung at Manchester United.[12] On 13 January 2018, Son scored a goal and provided an assist in a
            game against Everton, matching the club record set in 2004 by Jermain Defoe of scoring in five consecutive
            home games.[81] On 28 February 2018, Son scored a brace and assisted Fernando Llorente as Tottenham beat
            Rochdale 6–1 in the fifth round of the FA Cup. Son also converted a penalty, but his goal was overruled by
            the video assistant referee.[82] Son has become the first Asian to finish the season as a top-10 goal scorer
            in the English Premier League.
            <br>
        </p>

        <h5>2018–19: Champions League runner-up</h5>
        <p>
            On 20 July 2018, Son signed a new five-year deal extending his contract with Tottenham until 2023.[84] The
            first goals of the season came in October 2018 when he scored a brace in his 150th game for Tottenham in the
            2018–19 EFL Cup match against West Ham.[85] He scored his first league goal in the season, his 50th goal for
            the club in all competitions, in a solo effort in the 3–1 home win against Chelsea, inflicting the first
            defeat for Chelsea in the Premier League this season.[86][87] This goal won the Premier League's Goal of the
            Month award for November.[88] On 13 February 2019, Son scored the first goal in a 3–0 win over Borussia
            Dortmund, in the first leg of the round of 16, UEFA Champions League.[89] At the end of the month he was
            named Premier League Player of the Year at the London Football Awards.[90] On 3 April 2019, Son scored the
            first professional goal at the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in a 2–0 victory over Crystal Palace.
            <br>
            <br>
            On 9 April 2019, Son scored the first European competition goal at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in a 1–0
            win against Manchester City in the quarterfinals of the 2018–19 Champions League.[92] In the return leg, Son
            scored twice to earn Tottenham a 4–4 aggregate win on the away goals rule and help the club reach the
            semi-finals of the competition for the first time since 1962, and only the second time ever. His brace also
            saw him become the highest scoring Asian player in the history of the tournament with 12 goals, overtaking
            the previous record holder, Maxim Shatskikh.[93] On 4 May 2019, Son received his first red card in the
            Premier League due to his vindictive action against Jefferson Lerma.
        </p>

        <h5>2019–20: Puskás Award</h5>
        <p>
            Son opened his 2019–20 account on 14 September 2019 by scoring two goals against Crystal Palace in the
            Premier League with a final result of 4–0.[95] On 21 October, Son was named in the 30-man shortlist for the
            2019 Ballon d'Or.[96] On 3 November, Son was sent off during a 1–1 draw with Everton after sliding into
            André Gomes from behind, causing him to fall awkwardly and suffer a severe ankle injury. The injury prompted
            great concern and anguish from the players and supporters; Son was visibly highly distressed by the
            incident.[97] Following a red card for a challenge on Gomes, Son also received suspension for three Premier
            League games.[98] However, many professionals including former Everton player Kevin Kilbane expressed
            criticism of the red card decision, and Tottenham made an appeal to the Football Association against the
            dismissal. The FA accepted the appeal and Son's red card was rescinded on 5 November.[99][100] Three days
            after this incident, in a 4–0 Champions League away game to Red Star Belgrade, in which Son scored a brace,
            rather than celebrating his first goal, he apologised to the camera for what happened at Goodison Park.
            <br>
            <br>
            On 23 November 2019, Son scored Tottenham's first goal with José Mourinho as manager, earning him
            Man-of-the-match in a 3–2 Spurs victory against West Ham.[103] On 7 December, in the match against Burnley,
            Son ran from one end of the pitch to the other, going past seven Burnley players, to score an individual
            goal that was immediately labelled a goal of the season contender. The nature of the goal saw Mourinho dub
            him "Sonaldo Nazario" in reference to the type of goal former Brazilian international Ronaldo would
            score.[104] In January 2020, Son was awarded the Premier League goal of the month for December for his goal
            against Burnley,[105] eventually winning him the Goal of the Season award.[106] The goal was further
            recognised by FIFA with a Puskás Award as the best goal of the past 12 months in December 2020.
            <br>
            <br>
            On 22 December 2019, facing Chelsea, Son was sent off after raising his boot against Antonio Rüdiger's
            ribs.[108][109] On 16 February 2020, Son scored two goals at Villa Park and earned a 3–2 victory for
            Tottenham, in which he became the first Asian footballer to score 50 goals in the Premier League, with 51
            scored goals in 151 Premier League matches.[110] Son played the full game despite suffering a fracture to
            his arm at the 31st second of the game.[111] Head coach José Mourinho declared at a later stage that he was
            not optimistic regarding Son's injury and that it was likely that the South Korean would be sidelined for
            the rest of the season.
            <br>
            <br>
            On 6 April 2020, while football was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, it was confirmed that
            Son would carry out his mandatory military service for South Korea.[113] After completing a two-week
            quarantine on his return to Korea, he served with the Marine Corps for three weeks on Jeju Island.

        <h5>2020–21: PFA Team of the Year</h5>
        <p>
            In the second Premier League match of the 2020–21 season, Son scored four goals, all assisted by Harry Kane,
            in a 5–2 win against Southampton and the first League win and away win of the season. This was the first
            time in Premier League history in which a single player scored four goals in a match while being assisted by
            the same teammate.[115] In the Premier League game on 4 October, he scored a brace against Manchester United
            to help Tottenham win 6–1, which is the biggest win for Tottenham at Old Trafford and their best result
            against United since a home win in 1932.[116] Based on his performances, Son received his third Premier
            League Player of the Month award on 13 November 2020.
            <br>
            <br>
            On 28 January 2021, Son's counterpart on the Korean Women's National Team, Cho So-hyun joined FA WSL side
            Tottenham Hotspur on loan for the remainder of the 2020–21 season.[118] With Son already at the club it gave
            Spurs the rare distinction of having both the Men's and Women's Korean National Team Captains at one club.
            <br>
            <br>
            On 2 January 2021, Son scored his 100th goal for Tottenham in the 3–0 win against Leeds.[120] On 10 February
            2021, he provided three assists, but Tottenham lost 5–4 to Everton in the FA Cup.[121] On 7 March, Son
            provided an assist to Harry Kane in a 4–1 win against Crystal Palace, and this, their 14th combined goal
            effort whereby one assisted another, set a record for the most goal combinations in a single Premier League
            season.[122] After the end of the season, he and Kane were selected for the PFA Premier League Team of the
            Year, although Tottenham finished in seventh place.

        <h5>2021–22: Premier League Golden Boot</h5>
        <p>
            On 23 July 2021, Son extended his contract with Tottenham until 2025.[124] On 15 August, he scored his first
            goal of the season in the opening match against Manchester City, which ended in a 1–0 win.[125] On 4
            November, he scored in new manager Antonio Conte's first match in charge, a 3–2 victory over Vitesse in the
            group stage of the Europa Conference League. In doing so, Son had the distinction of scoring the first goal
            under each of Tottenham's last three permanent managers.[126][127] On 26 February, Son scored a goal against
            Leeds United in a 4–0 win; the goal was assisted by Harry Kane meaning this was the 37th time Kane and Son
            had combined to score, which set a new record in goal-scoring partnerships in the Premier League.
            <br>
            <br>
            On 9 April, Son scored a hat-trick against Aston Villa to give Spurs a 4–0 away win at Villa Park, and also
            break into Tottenham Hotspur all-time top 10 goalscoring list.[129][130] Son scored twice in a 5–0 win
            against Norwich City on the last day of the season securing a Champions League qualification for Tottenham,
            after finishing in fourth place in the Premier League, while also winning the Premier League Golden Boot
            alongside Mohamed Salah with 23 goals, becoming the first Asian player to do so.
            <br>
        </p>

        <h5>2022–23: 100th Premier League goal</h5>
        <p>
            After winning the Golden Boot the previous season, Son had a poor start to the 2022–23 season, failing to
            score any goal in the first eight games and proving only one assist.[132] He ended his goal drought in the
            game against Leicester City on 17 September, when he came off the bench to score a hat-trick in 13 minutes
            to help Tottenham win 6–2.[133] On 1 November, Son collided with Marseille's Chancel Mbemba during the final
            matchday of the UEFA Champions League group stage, which caused an orbital fracture in his left eye.[134]
            Son managed to recover enough to play in the 2022 World Cup for South Korea, wearing a protective mask in
            all his matches.
            <br>
            <br>
            On 19 February 2023, after scoring a 72nd minute goal against West Ham to secure a 2–0 victory, Son was
            subjected to online racist abuse, which was condemned as "utterly reprehensible" by Tottenham and the Kick
            It Out anti-racism organisation.[136] Despite enduring a difficult season for Tottenham, on 8 April, Son
            scored his 100th Premier League goal in a 2–1 win over Brighton & Hove Albion, and became the first Asian
            player to reach that landmark.
            <br>
            <br>
            The day after Tottenham's last league game of the season against Leeds United, on May 29, Son underwent an
            operation to treat a hernia issue.[138] In an interview with TV Chosun, Son revealed that he carried the
            injury with him for 8–9 months, which allowed him to play only at 60% of his normal ability for much of the
            season.
            <br>
        </p>

        <h5>2023–24: Inheriting the captaincy</h5>
        <p>
            On 12 August 2023, it was announced that Son had been made Tottenham's new captain, replacing Hugo
            Lloris.[140] On 2 September, he scored his first hat-trick as club's captain in a 5–2 away win over
            Burnley.[141] On 24 September, he scored two equalisers as Spurs drew 2–2 away against Arsenal in the North
            London derby, becoming the sixth player in the club's history to score 150 goals, after netting his 149th
            and 150th goals in the derby. Following the match, Son earned the praise of his manager Ange Postecoglou,
            stating that "he's been outstanding as a leader and as a player [...] we have put him in that nine position
            now and he just works so hard. He is so team-first orientated, it is incredible”.[142] He scored the opening
            goal against Liverpool on 1 October in a 2–1 victory at home, in Spurs' first victory against them in five
            years. This was his 200th professional goal in all competitions across top-division European football.[143]
            For his six goals in four games in September, he was later named Premier League Player of the Month, his
            fourth time receiving the award. He had a goal and two assists in a 4–1 victory over Newcastle United on 10
            December, becoming Tottenham's all-time assist leader in the Premier League with 83 assists.
            <br>
            <br>
            On 10 February 2024, Son made his return from the 2023 AFC Asian Cup, assisting teammate Brennan Johnson to
            score a 90+6th minute goal, a late minute winner in a 2–1 win over Brighton & Hove Albion. This prompted
            Postecoglou to hail him as "the best attacking player in the competition".[145] Son scored his first club
            goal of 2024 in a 3–1 victory against Crystal Palace, where he was also awarded the Player of the Match
            award.

        <h3>International career</h3>
        <h4>2009–2014: Youth level and first major tournaments</h4>
        <p>
            Son was a member of the South Korea national team that participated at the 2009 FIFA U-17 World Cup held in
            Nigeria.[147] He scored 3 goals in this tournament.
            <br>
            <br>
            On 24 December 2010, Son was named in South Korea national team's squad for the 2011 AFC Asian Cup,[148]
            making his debut for the national team in a pre-tournament friendly against Syria on 30 December.[149] At
            the tournament finals, Son scored his first international goal during a 4–1 group stage win against
            India.[150] This goal made him the youngest goalscorer in the AFC Asian Cup history.
            <br>
            <br>
            On 7 October 2011, after initially missing the first two matches of South Korea's 2014 FIFA World Cup
            qualification campaign on 2 and 6 September 2011 due to an ankle injury, Son played in a friendly against
            Poland, and was again featured in 11 October World Cup qualifier against the United Arab Emirates.[151][152]
            His selection for national team play was a point of concern for Son's father, however, who caused a stir by
            asking the Korea Football Association not to select his son for the national team in the immediate future so
            he can rest and mature more as a player. Cho Kwang-rae, then the South Korea head coach, responded by saying
            that he would continue to call up Son when needed.
            <br>
            <br>
            Son turned down the opportunity to participate in the 2012 London Olympics, opting to concentrate on his
            club career at Hamburger SV. Son was quoted as saying, "In Korea, an Olympic appearance has a special
            meaning, but I want to speed up for Hamburg. What matters is to pour all my time into team training."[154]
            Son did, however, play for the national team in the autumn of 2012 for two 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers
            against Lebanon and Iran,[155] and became a regular call-up in friendlies and World Cup qualifying matches
            in 2013. In the World Cup qualifier against Qatar on 23 March 2013, Son came on as a substitute in the 81st
            minute and scored the winning goal in the 96th minute.
            <br>
            <br>
            In June 2014, Son was named in South Korea's squad for the 2014 World Cup.[157] On 22 June, he scored in a
            4–2 defeat to Algeria in the team's second group match.[158] The Korea Football Association requested Bayer
            Leverkusen to allow Son to play in the 2014 Asian Games, as winning the gold medal at the tournament would
            grant Son exemption from military service. Despite Son affirming his interest and the KFA's efforts, Bayer
            Leverkusen refused to release him, as his absence would mean the team would lose him for at least six
            matches.
            <br>
        </p>

        <h4>2015–2018: Asian Cup runner-up and Asian Games gold</h4>
        <p>
            Son was selected for South Korea for the 2015 AFC Asian Cup in Australia. At the quarter-final stage, he
            scored both of the team's goals in the 2–0 extra time defeat of Uzbekistan.[160] In the final against the
            hosts, managed by future manager Ange Postecoglou, he equalised in added time, but his team lost 2–1 after
            extra time.[161] He was chosen as one of three forwards in the Team of the Tournament.
            <br>
            <br>
            In June 2016, Son was named as one of the three overage players in South Korea under-23 squad for the 2016
            Summer Olympics. Son amassed two goals in the group stages with a goal against Fiji and another against
            Germany, helping his team to top the group with two wins and a draw. South Korea was eliminated by Honduras
            in the quarterfinals, with Son missing crucial chances
            <br>
            <br>
            On 3 September 2015 at the Hwaseong Stadium, Son scored a hat-trick in an 8–0 home win over Laos in the
            second round of qualification for the 2018 World Cup.
            <br>
            <br>
            On 13 June 2017, Son broke his right forearm after falling awkwardly on his arm during a World Cup qualifier
            match in Doha against Qatar.[165] He was part of the team that saw Korea qualify for the 2018 World Cup
            after a 0–0 draw against Uzbekistan on 5 September 2017.[166] On 4 June 2018, Son was selected in 23-man
            squad for the World Cup.[167] On 23 June, Son scored a goal from outside the penalty area – a curling strike
            into the top corner – though his side was defeated with a 2–1 loss to Mexico in their second group stage
            match of the World Cup.[168] On 27 June, during their final group stage match, he scored the second goal in
            the 97th minute in their 2–0 victory over world champions Germany, sealing their elimination.
            <br>
            <br>
            Son was selected as one of three overage players permitted in the under-23 team for the football tournament
            at the 2018 Asian Games in Indonesia.[170] He captained the team in the final game of the group stage
            against Kyrgyzstan, scoring the only goal of the match to help the team reach the knockout rounds.[171] He
            also captained the team in the knockout rounds and reached the final after the Taeguk Warriors beat Vietnam,
            3–1.[172][173] In the gold medal match, Son assisted in both extra-time goals in a 2–1 victory over Japan,
            which guaranteed the entire squad's exemption from mandatory military service.
            <br>
        </p>

        <h4>2019–present: Assuming the captaincy</h4>
        <p>
            Son was called up as captain for the 2019 AFC Asian Cup in the United Arab Emirates by Paulo Bento, but
            missed the first two group matches due to an agreement with Tottenham Hotspur related to his call-up.[176]
            He recorded an assist in the third group game against China.[177] However, his play at the tournament was
            lethargic due to lack of physical strength in his busy schedule,[178] and he returned to London following
            his team's defeat in the quarter-finals to the eventual champion Qatar
            <br>
            <br>
            Despite, still recovering from an eye injury, in October 2022, Son was named to lead the 26-man South Korean
            squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[180] Due to the tenderness of his injury, Son wore a mask that covered
            nearly half his face. Son failed to score a goal for his nation's group stage matches, but successfully led
            South Korea to the round of 16, for the first time since 2010, following a match winning assist to Hwang
            Hee-chan in a shock 2–1 victory against Portugal on 2 December,[181] before being eliminated by Brazil
            following a 4–1 defeat on 5 December.
            <br>
            <br>
            Son played for the national team under manager Jürgen Klinsmann in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup. He won a penalty
            and converted it into the opening goal in the second group stage match against Jordan, which ended in a 2–2
            draw.[183] He scored South Korea's first penalty, contributing to a 4–2 penalty shoot-out win over Saudi
            Arabia in the round of 16.[184] His best performance in the competition came in a 2–1 quarter-final win over
            Australia, where he won a crucial penalty in second-half stoppage time and scored the winning goal with a
            free-kick in extra time.[185] South Korea once again met Jordan in the semi-finals, but he failed to prevent
            a 2–0 defeat to them.
